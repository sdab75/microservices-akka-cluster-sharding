If you use any IDE you can start AbcService/DefService as normal java applications.

Start AbcService
Start DefService
Wait for few seconds you will see. AbcService uses AbcPublisher to publish messages to the DefService. Similary, DefService uses DefPublisher to publish messages to the AbcService.
